# Bateman_Equations
The present repository contains a set of Python codes that solve the Bateman Equations for the general case, where there are repeated decay constants. These codes are described in the article A New Solution of the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetics Equations using Symmetry and the Heaviside’s expansion formula, which was recently submitted to the Progress in Nuclear Energy journal.

Mathematical and algorithmical generalities of the codes are described in the following lines with the purpose to provide some insight of the developed work. Nevertheless, a more detailed discussion is provided in the submitted article.
